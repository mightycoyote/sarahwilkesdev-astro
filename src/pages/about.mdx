## Professional bio

I transitioned into frontend web development during the pandemic, from a background mostly in higher ed, nonprofit marketing/fundraising, and content strategy. As a developer, I'm still passionate about content-first design, thoughtfully-built websites and CMSes, and accessibility.

My favorite projects are featured here in my portfolio, but there are even more on [FrontendMentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/mightycoyote).

<Details summary="Skills">
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SCSS, Tailwind, Bootstrap, CoreUI, CSS Modules, styled-components, React, Vite, Gatsby, WordPress, Drupal, PHP, MySQL, GraphQL, Docker, and Figma (and I've used more project tracking and business apps than I can count). 

I'm especially good at professional communication, solving complex problems, and keeping track of multiple competing tasks.
